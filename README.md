- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yenwee

- ðŸŒ± This will be a diary of my journey to learning and master software engineering, data analytics and data science. To do that, I will be practicing my skills on different use-cases from time to time. With each project, I will be writing my full thoughts and codes as to document this journey where I can reflect on them in future, without revealing private information.
